# Rock-Paper-Scissors

The rock-paper-scissors task for the Zuri training

The link to the raw code of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game is [this](https://github.com/Ogirimah/Rock-Paper-Scissors/blob/main/main.py "Links to the code")

The code pits the **player** against **CPU**, and determines the winner by comparing the input choice of the user with that of the CPU.

The pseudocode of the program is as follows

1. Initialize the program and keep it running
2. Create a list containing the game choices
3. Randomly select a choice for CPU
4. Get choice input for the user
5. Compare user choice with that of CPU
6.  If it is a tie, go back to *step 3*
7.  Print the result
8. Prompt if user wants to play again or quit
9. Stop program from running
